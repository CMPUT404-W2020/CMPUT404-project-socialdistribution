# Squawk Documentation

Squawk is a distributed social network that gives control back to the user. With Squawk, you get all the features you expect from a modern social network without sacrificing privacy or being flooded with promotional content. On every post you create, you can choose exactly who can view it. When viewing content, you can access the Explore page to see all public posts connected to your node, or head to Your Feed to see only the currated content that you chose to follow. 

## User Access
The website is hosted by Heroku at https://cmput-404.herokuapp.com/ 

Alternatively, one can run the app locally by running the following command from the social_distribution directory:
 
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	python3 models.py runserver


If you make local changes that result in database errors, try:
	
    python3 manage.py makemigrations
	python3 manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
	python3 manage.py migrate

Once the app is running, use your web browser to access: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

On first use, you will not be logged in but are granted access to the explore page. This allows users to explore public posts before deciding to sign up with Squawk. After signing in or making an account (click on the account button) you will be granted access to the full functionality. 

For testing, we have created a number of sample user credentials:

| First   | Last     | Username        | Password |
|---------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| James   | Smith    | JamesSmith      | cmput404 |
| John    | Johnson  | John Johnson    | cmput404 |
| Robert  | Williams | Robert Williams | cmput404 |
| Michael | Jones    | Michael Jones   | cmput404 |
| Ava     | Wilson   | Ava Wilson      | cmput404 |
| Olivia  | Lewis    | Olivia Lewis    | cmput404 |

## Admin Access

**TODO**: add superuser information for heroku. *not sure if django superuser is the same. Can we provide them with superuser login in that will work for them?

When running locally, you can run this command to create a superuser and access the admin interface:
	python3 manage.py createsuperuser


## Current API Call Formats: (master)

The format of request can be found in the example_requests folder (https://github.com/CMPUT404-W2020/CMPUT404-project-socialdistribution/tree/master/example_requests). 

**TODO**: update this 

The system only allows GET and POST requests; all other requests will be responded to with an HTTP 405 response
(will be updated to match social_distribution/sd/urls.py found on the api branch)

    
    auth/register               (POST)
    auth/logout                 (GET)
