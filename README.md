# Squawk Documentation

Squawk is a distributed social network that gives control back to the user. With Squawk, you get all the features you expect from a modern social network without sacrificing privacy or being flooded with promotional content. For every post you create, you decide exactly who can view it. When viewing content, you can access the Explore page to see all public posts connected to your node, or head to Your Feed to see only the curated content that you choose to follow.

## User Access

#### The website is hosted by Heroku at: https://cmput-404.herokuapp.com/

On first use, you will not be logged in but are granted access to the explore page. This allows users to explore public posts before deciding to sign up with Squawk. After signing in or making an account (click on the account button), you will be granted access to the full functionality.

For testing, we have created a number of sample user credentials:

| First   | Last     | Username        | Password |
| ------- | -------- | --------------- | -------- |
| James   | Smith    | JamesSmith      | cmput404 |
| John    | Johnson  | John Johnson    | cmput404 |
| Robert  | Williams | Robert Williams | cmput404 |
| Michael | Jones    | Michael Jones   | cmput404 |
| Ava     | Wilson   | Ava Wilson      | cmput404 |
| Olivia  | Lewis    | Olivia Lewis    | cmput404 |

## Site Features

Now that you're logged into your Squawk account, you can take advantage of all of the exciting features:

### Server to Server Connections

There is no more need to have accounts on countless social media sites; Squawk lets you pull information from different sources into one convenient feed. You can follow other authors within the Squawk server and all connecting servers. Refer to the "Current Connections" section in this document to see the servers available to you through Squawk or contact the Squawk admins to request a new server be added.

### Curate your Content

On **_Your Feed_** you see content from the authors that you follow. All of your posts, regardless of their privacy settings, will also be visible to you on your feed.

With our **_Github compatibility_**, see your github activity feed on your Squawk feed. Enable this option by adding your Github ID to your Squawk profile.

### Find New Content

Check out the **_Explore_** page to see all public posts from local and remote servers. This is a great way to find new authors to follow and to gain popularity through your public posts.

When you'd like to follow or unfollow an author, look them up on the **_Search_** page to change your current relationship.

You will be notified on the **_Notifications_** page when another author follows you. You can choose to follow them back and become friends, or dismiss the notification. Here you can also see a list of users you are following or are **_friends_** with.

### Own your Content

Choose how you display yourself to others by editing the information on your **_Account_** page.

Every post you create has several **_privacy_** options to choose from. If you set your post to **_public_**, then it will show on the explore page of all other users directly or indirectly connected to the Squawk server. Alternatively, you can restrict your post to the personal feeds of your **_friends_**, **_friends of friends_**, **_server only_**, or a spectific group of users with **_private_** posts. For added privacy, select **_unlisted_** and your post will only be visible to the aforementioned audience if you provide them with the direct link. If you change your mind later, you can easily edit your own posts and change their privacy setting.


## Admin Access

You can access the admin page through https://cmput-404.herokuapp.com/admin and using the credentials:

    username: warren
    password: cmput404

When running locally, you can run this command to create a superuser and access the admin interface:

    python3 manage.py createsuperuser

## Testing

There is a script for running tests. The tests require selenium, which should be installed when you run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the root directory of the project. Next, you need Firefox installed on your machine. Lastly, you need gecko installed on your machine, which can be done on a Mac by running `brew install gecko`. Then, ensure the test script is executable or run `chmod +x runtests.sh` to make it executable. Now, run `./runtests.sh` to run the tests! There are basic tests for the models and views as well as integration tests for all the major functionality. The tests should take approximately 4 minutes to run, so please be patient.

The following functions do not have automated tests as they all have alerts and Selenium has a known issue with dismissing alerts:
* Delete post
* Send friend request
* Unfriend another author
* Unfollow another author

It is possible that one of tests will fail on a unique key constraint. This is because we are testing the registration of a new user and this test communicates with our live server. To resolve this issue and have the test pass, login to [https://cmput-404.herokuapp.com/admin] with username "warren" and password "cmput404", navigate to the 'Users' tab, and delete the user with username 'Selenium'.
